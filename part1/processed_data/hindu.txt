Even Modi is forced to say ""vikas""; rarely does he explicitly talk of Hindutva, etc and that's in a Hindu majority country. 

So at this point, have to go w/ best available. My $0.02!"
"@rekharamaswamy @TulsiGabbard @TulsiPress There was a lot of anti Hindu propaganda which organizers failed to counter.

Other point is that ABV and LKA made many more mistakes yet we supported them. 

Tulsi is our best bet in US. She is the most openly Hindu politician. Crucifying her for a 1 partial mistake is stupid."
